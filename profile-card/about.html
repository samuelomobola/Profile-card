          <h1>Bio</h1>
          <p>
            I’m Temitope, a front-end developer with a creative twist. I love
            transforming ideas into experiences through clean design, thoughtful
            interactions, and storytelling. Beyond the screen, I’m a poet and
            musician who believes code and art share the same heartbeat —
            rhythm, structure, and intention. My goal is to create things that
            work beautifully and speak deeply.

          <h1>Goals In The HNG Internship</h1>
          <p>
            My goal in the HNG Internship is to deepen my understanding of
            front-end development tools and learn how to maximize their use in
            real projects. I also look forward to tapping into the wealth of
            knowledge from my mentors and peers, broadening my perspective and
            skillset. Ultimately, I aim to gain hands-on experience in what it
            truly means to be a front-end developer.

            To the me who’s grown, You’ve turned confusion into clarity and code
            into creation. You’ve learned that logic can be lyrical ; that every
            function, like every verse, can tell a story. Stay humble, stay
            curious, and let your art and code keep reflecting purpose.

        <section data-testid="test-about-extra">
          <h1>Extra thoughts</h1>
          <p>
            I see front-end development as more than just code — it’s
            storytelling through structure, design, and interaction. Every
            project feels like a canvas where logic meets creativity, and that’s
            what makes this journey exciting. I’m deeply grateful for the
            mentors, teammates, and moments that have stretched me beyond what I
            thought I could do. Going forward, I hope to keep growing — not just
            as a developer, but as a creator who builds experiences that
            inspire, serve, and connect people in meaningful ways.
